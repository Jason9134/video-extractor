# video-extractor
This is a tool to extract every frame and the audio from a video

# How to use:
Simply put the python script in a folder. Name your video "videoplayback.mp4" and open the .py file.
It will extract the frames to ../output/*.jpg and the audio to ../audio_output.mp3.

Have fun with this ^^
